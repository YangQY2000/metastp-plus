The code for a paper named "Spatial Meta Learning with Comprehensive Prior Knowledge Injection for Service Time Prediction", which does some effort in predicting service time of instance delivery, has been accepted by TKDE and will be published soon. This code is to help understand more implementation details.

In the fold of service_time_prediction, there are some Python scripts about our meta-learning based algorithm, our model and data processings.

Our method is completely implemented in Python 3.8 using PyTorch 1.11.
